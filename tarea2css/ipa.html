        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>11.75 lbs. (5.3 kg) US 2-row pale malt</li>
                <li>1.4 lbs. (0.64 kg) Munich malt (9 °L)</li>
                <li>13 oz. (0.36 kg) crystal malt (20 °L)</li>
                <li>9 oz. (0.25 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)</li>
                <li>16.3 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 13% alpha acid)</li>
                <li>16.3 AAU Simcoe® hops (5 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 13% alpha acid)</li>
                <li>1.25 oz. (35 g) Amarillo® hops (0 min.)</li>
                <li>1.25 oz. (35 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)</li>
                <li>½ tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)</li>

    <h3>Step by step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>This is a single infusion mash. Heat 4.5 gallons (17 L) of strike water for a mash ratio of about 1.25 quarts per pound of grain (2.6 L/kg). Target a mash temperature of 154 °F (68 °C) and hold for 60 minutes. Batch sparge with enough water to collect approximately 7 gallons (26.4 L) of wort runoff and bring to a boil. The goal is to get 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort into the fermenter.</li>
        <li>Boil the wort for 60 minutes adding the Nugget hops at the beginning, the yeast nutrients with 15 minutes left in the boil, and the Simcoe® hop addition with five minutes remaining in the boil. After turning off the heat, add the Amarillo® hops, then chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and pitch the yeast, preferably as a 1.5-L yeast starter if pitching liquid yeast. Hold at this temperature for the duration of primary fermentation. Fermentation should take 10–14 days. Following fermentation, dry hop with Citra® hops for five days before bottling or transferring to keg. Prime to 2.4 volumes of CO2.</li>
